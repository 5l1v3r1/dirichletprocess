## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Removed capitalisation of "Process Objects" in the DESCRIPTION.
* Added Dirichlet process reference in DESCRIPTION. 

## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 3.4.3
* ubuntu 14.04 (on travis-ci), R 3.4.2
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* This is a new release.

## Reverse dependencies

This is a new release, so there are no reverse dependencies.
